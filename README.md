- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT with refresh tokens
- **Security:** Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting, Input Validation

## 🪝 Custom Hooks

The application includes several reusable custom hooks for common patterns, located in `client/hooks/`:

| Hook | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `useApi` | Generic API fetching | Caching, auto-refetch, abort control |
| `useDebounce` | Delay value updates | Reduces API calls, better UX |
| `useDialog` | Dialog state | Simple open/close management |
| `useLocalStorage` | Persistent storage | Cross-tab sync, React state |
| `useTransactions` | Transaction data | Pagination, CRUD operations |
| `useBudgets` | Budget data | CRUD operations, preserve logic |

### Hook Details

**`useApi`** - Generic data fetching hook with built-in caching (30s default), automatic refetching, and request cancellation. Prevents duplicate API calls and reduces rate limiting.

**`useDebounce`** - Delays value updates until user stops typing/changing. Perfect for search inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls.

**`useDialog`** - Manages dialog/modal open/close state with simple `open()`, `close()`, and `toggle()` functions.

**`useLocalStorage`** - Synchronizes React state with browser localStorage. Automatically syncs across browser tabs. ⚠️ **Note:** Not used for sensitive data like tokens.

**`useTransactions`** - Handles transaction data fetching with cursor-based pagination, infinite scroll support, and delete operations.

**`useBudgets`** - Manages budget data with full CRUD operations including preserve functionality for copying budgets to next month.

All hooks provide TypeScript type safety and are optimized for performance.

## 🚀 API Routes

### Authentication (`/auth`)
- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout and revoke tokens
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info
- `PATCH /auth/me` - Update user profile (email, password)
- `DELETE /auth/me` - Delete user account (requires password confirmation)

### Transactions (`/transactions`)
- `GET /transactions` - List user transactions (with pagination)
- `POST /transactions` - Create new transaction
- `POST /transactions/search` - Search transactions
- `PATCH /transactions/:id` - Update transaction
- `DELETE /transactions/:id` - Delete transaction

### Budgets (`/budgets`)
- `GET /budgets` - List all user budgets
- `POST /budgets` - Create monthly budget
- `GET /budgets/:month/:year` - Get specific month's budget
- `PATCH /budgets/:month/:year` - Update budget
- `DELETE /budgets/:month/:year` - Delete budget
- `GET /budgets/status` - Get budget status for month/year
- `POST /budgets/:month/:year/preserve` - Preserve budget to next month
- `PATCH /budgets/:month/:year/toggle-preserve` - Toggle preserve setting

### Analytics (`/analytics`)
- `GET /analytics/overview` - Get financial overview (revenue, expenses, balance)
- `GET /analytics/monthly` - Get monthly trends (income vs expenses)
- `GET /analytics/daily` - Get daily spending for current month (expenses by day)
- `GET /analytics/categories` - Get category-wise breakdown

### Health Check
- `GET /health` - Service health check

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT authentication with token rotation
- HttpOnly cookies for secure token storage
- Rate limiting on all endpoints (disabled in development)
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTML/Script sanitization (DOMPurify) for user input
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- UUID-based transaction IDs (prevents enumeration)
- Account lockout after failed attempts (5 attempts → 15min lockout)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- CORS configuration with environment-based origins
- Request deduplication (prevents duplicate API calls)
- Token refresh caching (reduces unnecessary refresh calls)

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- **Request Deduplication** - Prevents duplicate concurrent API requests
- **API Response Caching** - 30-second cache for GET requests (reduces rate limiting)
- **Component Memoization** - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for optimized renders
- **Lazy Loading** - Chart components loaded on-demand (code splitting)
- **Custom Hooks** - Reusable data fetching hooks with built-in caching
- **Middleware Optimization** - Token refresh caching to prevent duplicate refresh calls

### Backend
- **Rate Limiting** - Configurable limits (disabled in development for testing)
- **Database Indexing** - Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Token Rotation** - Refresh tokens rotated on each use
- **Efficient Pagination** - Cursor-based pagination for transactions
